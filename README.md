Don Martin Sound Effects + Images

Select a random Don Martin sound effect (from the [array-based code](https://raw.github.com/cjwinchester/cjwinchester.github.io/master/sandbox/martin/martin.js) that was adapted from [the (totally tabular) Don Martin Dictionary](http://www.madcoversite.com/dmd-alphabetical.html))

Crude early prototype.
If nothing appears, either it's a giant image that takes a long time to load; or the image is just failing to load.
Will look into that.
Visual display is proof-of-concept only.
